## Information
~~This tools currently doesn't support anyone else beside HoloLive.~~
<br>
~~You are able to use it but it will not work 100% or the upload mapping will be kinda fucked.~~
<br>
~~To be honest, this tools works for every livestream in YouTube. It will only be broken when the stream is recorded and will be uploaded.~~

**This program now support Agency outside Hololive, you can check it on [dataset](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/tree/master/dataset) folder.**

I only fully support Linux for now because Windows is annoying to make this fully automatic and I'm lazy to write up the tutorial.

This tools also utilize [HoloLive Tools](https://hololive.jetri.co/) API and YouTube Data API v3 for YouTube streams.<br>
And utilize twitcasting API for the twitcasting streams.

If you want to see other VLiver to be added to this list, you can contact me at **Discord: N4O#8868**<br>
I'll try to add it to this program.

This tools is not modular yet, but once it setup you can just use it easily.

    You can edit your `${HOME}/.profile` file and add this:
    ```
    VTHELL_YT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"; export VTHELL_YT_API_KEY
    ```

### Setup Discord Announcer (OPTIONAL)
1. Setup a new channel in your discord server
2. Click the gear icon (Edit channel) beside the channel name
3. Click `Webhooks` then `Create Webhook`
4. Name it whatever you want and copy the webhook URL
5. With the same step as `Step 11` from [Get “YouTube Data API v3” API key.](#get-youtube-data-api-v3-api-key), you need to made a ENV key<br>
    You can edit your `${HOME}/.profile` file and add this:
    ```
    VTHELL_DISCORD_WEBHOOK="DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"; export VTHELL_DISCORD_WEBHOOK

### Setup VTHell
1. [Download](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/releases) or [clone](https://api.github.com/repos/noaione/vthell/zipball/master) this repository
2. Create `jobs` and `streamdump` folder inside vthell folder<br>
    Example:
    ```
    $ ls -alh ~/vthell/
    drwxr-xr-x  6 mizore mizore 4.0K Apr 12 04:27 .
    drwx------ 27 mizore mizore 4.0K Apr 12 08:57 ..
    -rwxr--r--  1 mizore mizore  176 Apr  9 03:51 addjob.sh
    drwxr-xr-x  2 mizore mizore 4.0K Apr 12 10:12 jobs
    -rwxr--r--  1 mizore mizore  102 Apr 12 04:27 runauto.sh
    -rwxr--r--  1 mizore mizore  113 Apr  9 03:51 runjob.sh
    drwxr-xr-x  2 mizore mizore 4.0K Apr 12 08:59 scripts
    drwxr-xr-x  2 mizore mizore 4.0K Apr 12 09:00 streamdump

    -rwxr--r--  1 mizore mizore 4.0K Apr  8 02:21 vtup.sh
    ```
3. Change all of this part

**In `scripts/schedule.py`**<br>
```py
BASE_VTHELL_PATH = (
    "/media/sdac/mizore/vthell/"  # Absoule path to vthell folder
)
```
Change `BASE_VTHELL_PATH` to the absolute path of your vthell folder

**In `scripts/vtauto_schedule.py`**<br>
```py
BASE_VTHELL_PATH = "/media/sdac/mizore/vthell/"  # Absoule path to vthell folder
```
Change `BASE_VTHELL_PATH` to the absolute path of your vthell folder

**In `scripts/vthell.py` AND In `scripts/twitcast.py`**<br>
```py
BASE_VTHELL_PATH = (
    "/media/sdac/mizore/vthell/"  # Absoule path to vthell folder
)
RCLONE_PATH = "/media/sdac/mizore/bin/rclone"  # path to rclone executable
RCLONE_TARGET_BASE = (
    "naomeme:Backup/VTuberHell/"  # base target upload drive and folder
)
BASE_VENV_BIN = (
    "/media/sdac/mizore/pip3/bin/"  # path to created python3 virtualenv bin
)

[...]

"""
Cookies must be Netscape format or the one that can be opened with CURL.

Netscape format:
URL  INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS  PATH  HTTPS_ONLY  EXPIRES  COOKIES_NAME  COOKIES_VALUE
.youtube.com  TRUE  /  TRUE  0  SAMPLES  SAMPLEVALUES
"""
COOKIES_NAME = "cookies.txt"  # Your cookies file name
```

**Update 1.9**<br>
This update introduce cookies support to be able to record member-only stream.<br>
Change `COOKIES_NAME` to your cookies that you put on the main vthell folder.

**WARNING**<br>
I only support Netscape format as seen on that top sample.

Change `BASE_VTHELL_PATH` to the absolute path of your vthell folder<br><br>
Change `RCLONE_PATH` to where you put your rclone file, you can find it with
```bash
$ which rclone
```
if you install it systemwide<br><br>
Change `RCLONE_TARGET_BASE` to what you configured before with `rclone config`<br>
`naomeme` is your drive name that you use<br>
`Backup/VTuberHell/` is your folder you want to use.<br>
So if you want to change it to drive `foo` and folder `VTuberBackup`: `foo:VTuberBackup/`<br><br>
Change `BASE_VENV_BIN` to where you setup your `virtualenv` folder, target it to the `bin` folder that contain stuff like this:
```bash
$ ls -alh ~/pip3/bin/

```

**In most of the bash file**<br>
Change `/media/sdac/mizore/pip3/bin/python3` to your virtualenv python
Change `/media/sdac/mizore/vthell/scripts` to your absolute path of your vthell scripts folder

**In `vtrip.sh`**<br>
Change this:
```bash
YTDL_PATH="/media/sdac/mizore/pip3/bin/youtube-dl"
PY3_PATH="/media/sdac/mizore/pip3/bin/python3"
VTHELL_PATH="/media/sdac/mizore/vthell"
```
Set the `YTDL_PATH` to your `youtube-dl` in virtualenv `bin` folder
Set the `PY3_PATH` to your `python3` in virtualenv `bin` folder
Set the `VTHELL_PATH` to your absolute path of your vthell folder

**In `vtup.sh`**<br>
Change this:
```bash
BASE_TARGET="naomeme:Backup/VTuberHell"
RCLONE_PATH="/media/sdac/mizore/bin/rclone"
```
Set the `RCLONE_PATH` to where you put your rclone file, you can find it with
```bash
$ which rclone
```
if you install it systemwide<br><br>
Change `BASE_TARGET` to what you configured before with `rclone config`<br>
`naomeme` is your drive name that you use<br>
`Backup/VTuberHell/` is your folder you want to use.<br>
So if you want to change it to drive `foo` and folder `VTuberBackup`: `foo:VTuberBackup/`

3. You're mostly ready to use this """program"""


### Configuring auto-scheduler
**Main file: [scripts/vtauto_schedule.py](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/scripts/vtauto_schedule.py)**<br>
**[dataset/_auto_scheduler.json](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/dataset/_auto_scheduler.json)**

**Update 2.0**
<br>
This update separate the mapping to it's own file, to edit if you want to enable Nijisanji or Hololive<br>
you can refer to the `vtauto_schedule.py` file.

While the `dataset/_auto_scheduler.json` contain what you want to allowed (enabled) or ignored (disabled).<br>
The format are still the same as before, you can still follow the instructions below.

**Update 1.9**
<br>
This update introduce Nijisanji to the auto uploader, you can enable/disable it on the main file.
```py
"""
Set to True or False if you want it to be processed/scheduled automatically

Default:
- Enable Hololive
- Disable Nijisanji
So, it will process Hololive but skip Nijisanji completely.
"""
PROCESS_HOLOLIVE = True
PROCESS_NIJISANJI = False
```

There's 2 main part to edit, `enabled` and `disabled`<br>
`enabled` are streams that will be scheduled if it match one of the defined conditions.<br>
While `IGNORED_MAP` will remove anything that match the conditions.

The default one for `enabled` are:
- Towa ch.
- Korone ch.
- Any title containing: `歌う`
- Any title containing: `歌枠`
- Any title containing: `歌雑談`
- Any title containing: `ASMR`
- Any title containing: `うたうよ`

The default one for `disabled` are:
- All HoloStars Channel
- Any title containing: `(cover)`
- Any title containing: `あさココ`

There's only 2 supported `type` now:
- `channel`
- `word`

`channel` will record/ignore any upcoming live from the `channel`<br>
`word` will record/ignore any upcoming live when the title have the certain `word`

Example:
```json
{"type": "word", "data": "歌う"}
```
Record anything that have `歌う` (utau) in the title

```json
{"type": "channel", "data": "UC1uv2Oq6kNxgATlCiez59hw"}
```
Record anything from `channel`: `UC1uv2Oq6kNxgATlCiez59hw` (`UC1uv2Oq6kNxgATlCiez59hw` are channel ID)<br>
Channel ID are provided in dataset folder.

You can add more by just creating a new line after the last one.<br>
You also can remove any predefined one if you want.

### Configuring Twitcasting
**Main file: [scripts/twitcast.py](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/scripts/twitcast.py)**

**NOTE**<br>
I need help expanding the twitcast user ID, please contact me at Discord: N4O#8868

There's only 1 part you need to edit: `ENABLED_USERS` variable<br>

The default one enabled are:
- natsuiromatsuri

You only need to add the user ID to the `ENABLED_USERS` lists<br>
You can check the User ID on `upload_mapping` variable.

## Running
#### [addjob.sh](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/addjob.sh)
**./addjob.sh** [youtube_link1] [youtube_link2] [youtube_link_etc]

Supported youtube link format are:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID
- https://youtu.be/VIDEOID

It will create a .json files containing some info that will be parsed by `runjob.sh` or `vthell.py`

Using **Youtube Data API v3** to determine output filename.<br>
**Output filename format**: `[YYYY.MM.DD] TITLE [RESOLUTIONp AAC].mkv`

#### [runjob.sh](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/runjob.sh)
**./runjob.sh**

You can use **`cronjob`** to run every minute or whatever interval you want or run it manually.

It will check all `.json` in `jobs` folder and process the one that are not processed yet.

***What will be checked?*** the .json file<br>
The json file contains 3 keys that will be used to check:
- **`startTime`** if the `startTime` not less than 2 minutes left, it will be skipped completely
- **`isDownloaded`** stream `finished`, and file is being muxed and will be uploaded.
- **`isDownloading`** will skip if True to `prevent double recording`.

After **1 minutes left before stream**, it will use **streamlink** to check if stream online or not.<br>
If not continue, if yes start recording.

After stream finished, file will be muxed into .mkv and will be uploaded, .ts file will be deleted and also the .json files.

**Recommended cron schedule:**
```sh
*/1 * * * * /path/to/vthell/runjob.sh
```

#### [runauto.sh](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/runauto.sh)
**./runauto.sh**

You can use **`cronjob`** to run every 3 minute or whatever interval you want or run it manually.

It will fetch to [HoloLive Jetri](https://hololive.jetri.co/) endpoint to get upcoming live and ongoing live.<br>
It will add whatever in `ENABLED_MAP` variable, like channel or certain words in a title.<br>
You can add what you don't want to `IGNORED_MAP` variable.<br>
After that, it will check all `.json` in `jobs` folder and add the one that are not exist yet.

**To customize refer to: [Configuring auto-scheduler](#configuring-auto-scheduler)**

**Recommended cron schedule:**
```sh
*/3 * * * * /path/to/vthell/runauto.sh
```

#### [runtwit.sh](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/runtwit.sh)
**./runtwit.sh**

You can use **`cronjob`** to run every 2 minute or whatever interval you want or run it manually.

It will fetch to Twitcasting frontend API endpoint to check if `ENABLED_USERS` are live or not.<br>
If it's it will add a "LOCK" file to jobs folder to ensure that no duplicate will be added.<br>
After it finish, it will unlock again the file and the final file will be uploaded.<br>

**To customize refer to: [Configuring auto-scheduler](#configuring-twitcasting)**

**Recommended cron schedule:**
```sh
*/2 * * * * /path/to/vthell/runtwit.sh
```

#### [vtrip.sh](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/vtrip.sh)
**./vtrip.sh** [url]

Download your vtuber (mainly holo) video from youtube.<br>
Doesn't support playlist.<br>
Output format are: `[YYYY.MM.DD] TITLE [RESOLUTION AAC].mkv`<br>
YYYY.MM.DD are Date uploaded or streamed.<br>
Combine with `vtup.sh` later

[vtrip_helper.py](https://github.com/noaione/vthell/blob/master/scripts/vtrip_helper.py) are helper to determine the output name using Youtube Data API v3.

**Don't use this if you're ripping currently live streamed video, use addjob.sh for that**

#### vtup.sh
**REMOVED**

`vtup.sh` are now removed since version 1.9 since it's support more Agency.


## Troubleshooting
> Stream xxxxxx are paused

Enable it again when the VTuber start streaming by using `./addjob.sh [youtube_link]`

> Error 429

You're being rate limited by YouTube there's nothing you can do except using proxy temporarily

> "Please add VTuber from xxx."

If you want me to add that VTuber into the list, please help me compile them with the same format as most `dataset` list.<br>
**You can contact me at Discord: N4O#8868**

> "I added DISCORD_WEBHOOK to my ENV key but I'm not getting any announcement"

Replace the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = os.getenv("VTHELL_DISCORD_WEBHOOK", "")` with<br>
```py
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"
```
